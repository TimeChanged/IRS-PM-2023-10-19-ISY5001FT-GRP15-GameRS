## GameRS: Game Recommendation System


## SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / PAPER ABSTRACT
In today's digital era, the gaming industry has witnessed exponential growth, offering a vast array of games across numerous categories. To cater to the diverse preferences and ever-evolving trends, it has become crucial to develop a robust and efficient game recommendation system. Such a system aims to enhance the user experience by suggesting relevant games tailored to individual preferences. Our projectâ€™s aim is serving users better and keeping up with the dynamic nature of the gaming industry with a multifunctional and convenient game recommendation system.

To meet these demands, our system will focus on game matching, user profiling, chatbot interface, game introduction, and advanced recommendation algorithms. We will ensure quick and accurate game matching based on factors such as genre and gameplay style. Users will have personalized profiles where they can input their gaming preferences, playing habits, and favorite genres. Our chatbot interface will provide a convenient way for users to search, answer basic questions, and display relevant data. The system will also include an introduction page for each game to provide detailed information. Advanced recommendation algorithms will continuously learn and adapt based on user feedback, improving the accuracy and relevance of game suggestions.

In conclusion, we successfully developed a multifunctional and convenient game recommendation system using IRS knowledge with python, html, javascript and flask. It has main functions like game/genre based recommendation, chatbot interface, data visualization, blur search, user account and so on. With our Personalization, Two-way and Conversational system, we expect a good market impact and bridge function.
