## SECTION 1 : PROJECT TITLE
## GameRS: Game Recommendation System


## SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / PAPER ABSTRACT
In today's digital era, the gaming industry has witnessed exponential growth, offering a vast array of games across numerous categories. To cater to the diverse preferences and ever-evolving trends, it has become crucial to develop a robust and efficient game recommendation system. Such a system aims to enhance the user experience by suggesting relevant games tailored to individual preferences.

The gaming market encompasses a wide range of game genres and categories. From action-packed adventures to immersive role-playing experiences, there are countless options available to players. However, with this vast selection, finding games that align with personal interests can be challenging. Therefore, the development of a comprehensive recommendation system can greatly assist users in discovering new games that they may enjoy.

It is important to recognize that different players exhibit varying preferences at different stages or periods. For example, casual gamers might prefer puzzle or arcade games for short bursts of entertainment, while hardcore gamers might lean towards intense multiplayer or open-world experiences. Understanding these preferences and tailoring recommendations accordingly is essential for a successful game recommendation system.
